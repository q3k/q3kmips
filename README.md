The little MIPS that couldn't.

What is it?
-----------

It's a classic-pipeline, hand-crafted, partial MIPS32 implementation. It probably doesn't hold any intristic value, as it's a way for me to learn computer architecture from the ground up.

See `pipeline.grphml` for a yEd diagram of what this whole thing looks like.

Is it any good?
---------------

Not yet, really. It's a work in progress - the Fetch and ICache modules seem to be working and are tested. The decode stage is in progress, the rest is planned.
